# DSA210Project

The goal of this project is to analyze my personal League of Legends match data, obtained using the Riot Developer API. Additionally, I have requested further account data from Riot Games, though I am currently waiting their response. For this analysis, I plan to focus on my last 300 matches to ensure that the dataset is both current and large enough to draw meaningful conclusions. The analysis will be based on the outcomes of my games, categorized as wins or losses. I will create visuals to explore correlations between my winrate and various other match data such as gold income, game length, damage dealt, level lead and many more. I will be testing the hypothesis that my win rate increases as the game lenght is more than 30 minutes.
