# DSA210Project

My goal in this project is to explore and anaylse my own League of Legends match data. I obtained my dataset through Riot Development API. Firstly I used the API to access my puuid. With the puuid, I was able to obtain all the Solo Queue match IDs that I have played in the 2024. I also included the matches that I played between 01.01.2025-01.08.2025(end of season 14) to increase the amount of data. I used the match IDs to send requests. Since my development key had a limit of 100 API request per 2 minutes, I had to induce a 1.2 second delay between each call to not exceed that limit. After that, I explored the data and realised that, there were remakes in the data that could potentially worsen my analysis, because of that I created my data frame with only using games that lasted more than five minutes. I also changed True and False values into 1s and 0s and converted the start time stamps of the games into seconds from unix timestamps. To gather further understanding on my data I did some exploratory data analysis to see patterns. I checked the amount of games that i have played in each month and used a bar plot to visualize it.(PNG0)
